Artemis Financial is a financial services company which would like to modernize their 
operations.  They reached out in need of a series of security-related services such as 
the identification of vulnerabilities in their web-based software application with 
false positives suppressed, and the encryption of their archive files. 

Upon obtaining the results of the vulnerability checks using the vulnerability report 
maven plugin, I studied each of the vulnerabilities and created a comprehensive report 
meant to make it easier for professionals (including non-technical individuals) to 
interpret the results and understand each vulnerability and its potential implications. 
I then suppressed each of the vulnerabilities which would constitute a false positive 
in order to simplify the report and get rid of information which would not be useful.  
Secure coding is of the utmost importance in protecting system and user data.  Secure 
coding practices protect the systems and the data of organizations from malicious 
actors.

One aspect of the vulnerability assessment which I found challenging was the sheer 
volume of information which needed to be reviewed and interpreted.  While the process 
was somewhat daunting, I powered through and was left very satisfied when everything 
had been addressed and documented.

Throughout the projects we worked on for Artemis Financial, we incrementally added 
security layers to Artemis Financlal’s system including checksum validation, data 
encryption, use of self-signed certificates, and use of secure transfer protocols such 
as HTTPS.  I am very likely to use the OWASP dependency check Maven tool in the future.  
I will implement this incredibly useful tool into my mitigation techniques after manual 
review and before testing with written test documents.

I made certain that the code and software application were functional and secure by 
reviewing for weak or insecure code which might cause or represent vulnerabilities.  
After refactoring the code, I checked to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities 
using the OWASP dependency check Maven tool.  This was of course after suppressing false 
positives by including them in my ‘suppression.xml’ file.

My experience working on these projects led me to come across a variety of tools and 
coding practices which are likely to be helpful to me in the future.  Coding practices 
which I believe will be especially useful include the use of the SHA256 algorithm to 
encrypt and decrypt data, the use of self-signed certificates, and the use of checksum 
verification.  Considering software development tools to be used during development, the 
OWASP dependency check Maven tool may be the most relevant tool which I had come across 
for this purpose.

Future employers in the cybersecurity industry would likely be glad to know that I know 
how to identify, classify, and address security vulnerabilities during or after the 
development process.  They would also likely be glad to see that I know how to set up 
embedded servers and encrypt data being transferred to and from them, how to use checksum 
verification to make sure that communication is taking place with the correct server, and 
how to use certificates to build trust between servers and client machines so that 
sensitive data can be transferred safely as needed.
